• Data analysis 📊 is a process of inspecting, transforming, and monitoring to turn raw data into valuable insights. It summarizes collected data and involves the 
  interpretation of data gathered through the use of analytical and logical reasoning to determine patterns, relationships or trends.

• Power BI is a business analytics tool that is owned by Microsoft and it provides advanced analytic tools, reports and visualizations.

• The aim is to explore & analyse the data of the T20 World Cup 🏆 held in 2022 in Australia and to obtain meaningful insights in order to evaluate player performances and also to pick up the Best 11 of the Tournament ✨



• This repository consist of all the files and folders required to set up the project :

   (1) Primarily the data was available in the json file format in the "___t20_json_files___" folder. So, we need to perform Data Preprocessing in order to process the available data using Pandas Python library and converting the json data into csv file. The preprocessed data (Jupyter Notebook) file is provided in the repo viz. "__Data Preprocessing__".
   
   (2) All the csv files, or we can say the usual dataset used to perform data analysis is contained in the "___t20_csv_files___" 📁

   (3) The "__T20I WC Data Analytics (Basic Analytic Visualisation)__" 📈 file displays the basic analysis & visualisation of the Cricketer Dataset with different sections of different player categories segregated and filtered according to their performance throughout the tournament.

   (4) A proper modelled Dashboard 🤩 representing the player analysis and the Best 11 of the tournament is featured in the "__T20I WC Data Analytics (Modelled Visualisation)__" file.
